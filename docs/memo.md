Few-shot learning for satellite image segmentation is crucial for urban planning and disaster response. Traditional deep learning requires thousands of labeled samples, but few-shot learning enables rapid adaptation to new geographic regions with minimal labeled data.

**Policy Applications:**
- Urban development monitoring
- Disaster damage assessment
- Property tax assessment
- Solar panel installation planning
